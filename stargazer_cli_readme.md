# Stargazer CLI ðŸŒŒ

**Stargazer CLI** is a Python command-line application that lets you explore constellations by month, see random constellations, and learn their mythology. This project demonstrates the power of Python basicsâ€”dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and functionsâ€”applied to a fun, interactive tool.

---

## Features
- List all constellations
- Search constellations by month
- Show a random constellation
- Interactive menu-driven CLI
- Optional colored terminal output using `colorama`

---

## Installation

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You can check by running:
```bash
python --version
```

2. (Optional) Install `colorama` for colored terminal output:
```bash
pip install colorama
```

---

## How to Run
Navigate to the project folder and run the program:
```bash
python stargazer.py
```

Follow the menu prompts to explore constellations by month, see a random constellation, or list all of them.

---

## Example Usage
```
Welcome to Stargazer CLI!

Menu:
1. List all constellations
2. Search constellations by month
3. Show a random constellation
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1-4):
```

- **Search by month:** Enter any month name (e.g., "January") to see constellations visible that month.  
- **Random constellation:** Discover a constellation at random with its mythology and type.  

---

## Learning Points
- **Python Basics in Action:** Dictionaries, lists, loops, conditionals, and functions  
- **Modular Code Design:** Each feature is implemented in its own function  
- **Input Handling & Validation:** Robust CLI input handling  
- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Nested data structures and random selection  
- **Scalable Design:** Easy to expand with more constellations or JSON data  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Read constellation data from a JSON file for easier updates
- Add more constellations for each month
- Include images or ASCII art for visual appeal
- Build a GUI version
